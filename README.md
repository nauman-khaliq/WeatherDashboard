## About Weather Dashboard

Weather Dashboard showcases:
- MVVM & Clean architecture
- Search the weather of any city
- Displays Weather Icon, City Name, Weather condition, Temperature, Weather condition description
- Last searched City persistence
- Clean and modern UI

## Decisions & Trade-offs
- Used XML for UI to best focus on the Separation of concerns and clean code. I can work with Compose as well, but more experienced and an expert in XML
- Wanted to use Room for data persistence, but dropped the idea to focus on what is required in the assignment within in time constraint.

## If I had more time
- Would use the recommended api for weather using Lat Lng because by city name is deprecated. Mostly if working on a real-world app.
- Would use Room for data caching 
- Would use Jetpack Compose for UI.
